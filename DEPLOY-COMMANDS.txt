====================================
GITHUB PAGES DEPLOYMENT - NEXT STEPS
====================================

✅ COMPLETED:
- Git repository initialized
- All files committed (14 files)
- Ready to push to GitHub

📝 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW:

STEP 1: Create GitHub Repository
---------------------------------
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: blind-attack-4
3. Description: Blind Attack 4 - Connect 4 game where you can't see the board
4. Select: Public
5. DO NOT initialize with README (we already have files)
6. Click "Create repository"

STEP 2: Push Your Code
-----------------------
After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands.
I've prepared them for you below. Just copy/paste into your terminal:

(Make sure you're still in the blind-attack-4 folder)

# Add your GitHub repo as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/blind-attack-4.git

# Push your code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

STEP 3: Enable GitHub Pages
----------------------------
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" (in left sidebar)
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Select branch: main
6. Select folder: / (root)
7. Click "Save"
8. Wait 1-2 minutes

STEP 4: Access Your App
------------------------
Your app will be live at:
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/blind-attack-4

Open this URL on your iPhone in Safari and "Add to Home Screen"!

====================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
====================================

If you get "permission denied":
- You may need to authenticate with GitHub
- Use: git config --global user.name "Your Name"
- Use: git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
- May need to set up SSH keys or use personal access token

Alternative: Use GitHub Desktop
- Download from: https://desktop.github.com/
- Easier visual interface
- No command line needed
